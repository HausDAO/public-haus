# What is a pubkeeper?

A barkeep, also known as a bartender or barmaid (depending on gender), is a person who prepares and serves alcoholic (and sometimes non-alcoholic) beverages behind a bar in a pub, tavern, restaurant, or other drinking establishment. The role of a barkeep includes a variety of tasks and responsibilities:

1. **Mixing Drinks**: Barkeepers are skilled in mixing cocktails and other beverages according to recipes or customer preferences.
2. **Serving Customers**: They serve drinks to customers, ensuring that everyone is attended to in a timely manner.
3. **Customer Service**: Barkeepers often engage with customers, providing friendly and efficient service, and sometimes offering a listening ear or conversation.
4. **Maintaining the Bar Area**: They keep the bar area clean and well-stocked, including washing glasses, restocking bottles, and organizing supplies.
5. **Handling Payments**: Barkeepers manage transactions, including taking payments, giving change, and keeping track of tabs.
6. **Checking IDs**: Ensuring that customers are of legal drinking age is an important part of their responsibilities.
7. **Monitoring Consumption**: They also need to be aware of customers' alcohol consumption and may refuse service to those who are visibly intoxicated or disruptive.
8. **Knowledge of Beverages**: Barkeepers typically have extensive knowledge of different types of alcoholic beverages, including beers, wines, and spirits, as well as the ability to make recommendations to customers.

In addition to these tasks, an experienced barkeep may also handle inventory management, create new drink recipes, and contribute to the overall atmosphere and success of the establishment.
