# Make Payments From Superfluid

Payments for PublicHaus maintenance are made using [Superfluid](https://www.superfluid.finance/) on OP Mainnet.

Protocolooors and Platformoooors each receive 0.75 ETHx per month for their chores around the $HAUS. These funds are used at the discretion of the wearer of the Hat associated with that role. Funds are used for paying for various tasks and bounties required for keeping the $HAUS in order.

- [Platformoooors](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/trees/10/24?hatId=24.2.5)

## Streams

Superfluid uses a combination of Super ETH (ETHx) and Constant Inflow NFTs (CIF) to make their magic.
