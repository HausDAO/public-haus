# Facilitate Demo Day

Facilitating Demo Day demands a bold and spirited approach to guarantee an event that celebrates our community's graft and achievements. The facilitator, acting as the Master of Ceremonies (MC), is responsible for keeping the crowd engaged, maintaining a lively atmosphere, and ensuring the event stays on schedule. Here's what's needed:

- Start Event on Discord
- Welcome attendees
- Set the stage with an introduction to the season's Objectives
- Spill what you’re hyped about
- Introduce each project
- Stir up questions and keep the dialogue gritty
- Wrap it up with a bang
- Tease brilliance of the coming season

## Role of the Facilitator

As the MC, you’re the heartbeat of the event, like a rogue in a rowdy tavern. Your role is to ensure that:

- We hit our marks so every project gets its spotlight.
- The atmosphere is celebratory.
- Participants feel valued and fired up.

By following these steps, we can ensure a Demo Day that’s as unforgettable as the community that built it. Let’s show ‘em what we’re made of and revel in our shared chaos and creativity.
