# Schedule Demo Day

We have a quarterly Demo Day for DAOhaus. This event is to share the work completed in the season. The work should be related to the season's objectives but anything community members shipped and want to share is fair game. It is a time catch up and celebrate our accomplishments.

## Create Discord Event

Schedule Demo Day during the last Community Camp meeting of the current season. Create a Discord event and forum discussion.

- **Event Topic**: Season `#` Demo Day
- **Start Date:** Last Tuesday of season
- **Start Time**: 15:00 CDT

**Description:**

Join us for Season `#` Demo Day, a ritual gathering where our community comes together to showcase and celebrate the work we have accomplished this season. Whether it aligns with our seasonal objectives or it's a passion project that shipped, it's all fair game. This is our time to catch up, support each other, and revel in our collective spirit. Let's make some noise and show what DAOhaus is all about!
