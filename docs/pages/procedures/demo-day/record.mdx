# Record Demo Day

## Preparation

### OBS

- Install/update [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)
- Set up scene
  - Add Discord application (this is finnicky and may need to be re-selected between sessions) and fit to recording area (trim as needed for privacy)
  - Add "Audio Output Capture"
  - If you add local microphone (not needed) mute it as the use of multiple devices will have your voice coming through the output capture
- Ensure enough disk space for length of recording (~1GB/hr)
- Adjust volume levels and test the scene
- If this is your first time, run a short test record to verify setup

### Discord

- Create alt account (or use existing)
  - Log in with this account on recording machine, stay on mute
  - Join server you plan to record, ensure channel access
  - Log in with normal account on another device
  - This is done so that recorder can talk without fiddling with OBS (and still be recorded)

## Recording

- Optionally switch to streamer mode on Discord (this might be automatic)
- Ask host to let you know when to start and stop recording
  - Start when host says so
  - Stop when finished

## Editing

- If editing is required, figure that out
