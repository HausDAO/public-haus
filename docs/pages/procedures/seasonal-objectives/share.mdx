## Calculate Results

Open the [DAOhaus Retro Rewards 2024](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H3LddNt9qqzbfUJf2My6N79QCz440l653lFPcswULbA/edit?usp=sharing) Google Sheet. If you do not have access please request it from Ξ2T.

Duplicate the `Season # Objectives`tab and rename it according to the current season.

You will need to populate the data in the spreadsheet from the corresponding TCR. For Example, [PublicHaus Season #6 Objectives](https://signal.daohaus.fun/#/0xa/0xf5d6b637a9185707f52d40d452956ca49018247a/tcr/0x55d8a5fb55e6f960edaeaec5d24c3424027d8051)

1. Copy the name of **Objectives** into Column A

2. For each objective, copy the **Total Staked** number in white and paste it into the spreadsheet.
3. For each objective, copy the **Quadratic Votes** number in red and paste it into the spreadsheet.
4. Calculate the totals for both **Total Staked** and **Quadratic Votes**

5. For the **Total nvPUB** paste the total from the DAO Tokens section of the [DAO Settings](https://admin.daohaus.club/#/molochv3/0xa/0xf5d6b637a9185707f52d40d452956ca49018247a/settings) page.
6. **Participation %** is calculated by dividing **Total Staked** by **Total nvPUB**.
