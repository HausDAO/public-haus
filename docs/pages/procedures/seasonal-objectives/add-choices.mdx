# Add Seasonal Objectives Choices

Once the proposal for the Objectives Signal Session has been [executed](/procedures/seasonal-objectives/execute) we can add the choices for seasonal objectives.

Additional choices can be added by the community but adding the projects from the [Seasonal Objectives](/procedures/seasonal-objectives/discuss) discussion provides options.

## Generate Content

### Titles and Descriptions

Copy and paste the Markdown from the [Seasonal Objectives](/procedures/seasonal-objectives/discuss) discussion into Chat-GPT under the following prompt:

```bash
How could we summarize this list into 5 primary objectives?
```

```bash
What are the best ways to write these objectives according the OKR format from Measure What Matters?
```

```bash
Okay if these are the primary objectives:

- Objective 1
- Objective 2
- Objective 3
- Objective 4
- Objective 5

How can we rewrite the key results to include information from our notes?
```

```bash
Instead of writing the key results for each objective lets phrase those as paragraphs describing the possibilities of what people could work on.
```

### Images

Next you will need to generate an image for each objective. You can choose whatever keywords you want to style the prompts but each should include the objectives from above.

**Example Midjourney Prompt**:

```bash
\imagine propaganda poster, in style of Shepard Fairey, poster is for promoting Objective 1, punk, dark blue --ar 16:9
```
