# Discuss Seasonal Objectives

The Community Camp following Demo Day should be dedicated to aligning on what contributors want to work on in the coming season. This is subjective and can be based on what the Haus needs most or what individuals are interested in exploring.

Ideally the discussion can be timeboxed into a workshop format. Make sure someone is assigned to taking notes during the discussion. You can use a whiteboard in Discord or Miro for the community to input ideas.

Document the agreed-upon high-level objectives in a Markdown document on [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/team/daohaus?nav=overview). Summarize key decisions, actions, and objectives.

Share the document with the community in the Season `#` Objectives forum post on Discord.
