# Create Retro Signal Session

Retro Signal Sessions reward contributors for work completed in a season that supports the DAOs priorities from the Objective Signal Session.

The Retro Signal Session is a two week event that happens at the end of each quarter.

The proposal to Create a Signal TCR should be submitted 14 days before the end of the month. The end date of the proposal should be set for the last day of the month. It is helpful to add an event on the calendar to provide a reminder to start this process.

- **Voting Period**: 4 days
- **Grace Period**: 3 days
- **Retro Signal Session**: 7 days

## Setup

### Verify Staking is Paused

Staking in the DAO should be paused prior to starting the Retro Signal Session.

To verify staking is paused goto [Stake HAUS](https://join.daohaus.fun/#/join) and confirm the following banner is displayed:

![Staking Paused Banner](/images/staking-paused.png)

You can also verify staking is paused in the [`targetDAO.tsx`](https://github.com/HausDAO/publichaus/blob/main/src/targetDAO.tsx#L30) file on GitHub.

### Pause Staking

If staking is not currently paused you need to take the following steps to pause staking prior to starting the Retro Signal Session:

1. Goto [`targetDAO.tsx`](https://github.com/HausDAO/publichaus/blob/main/src/targetDAO.tsx#L30) on GitHub.
2. Click pencil icon to "Edit this file"
3. Change:

```tsx
STAKE_PAUSED: false,
```

to:

```tsx
STAKE_PAUSED: true,
```

### Resume Staking

1. Use [dEth Tools](https://tools.deth.net/unix-epoch-utc-conversion) to get the date on the first of next month when staking should resume.

2. Copy the Unix epoch (in miliseconds):
3. Edit the Unix epoch
   - Since the epoch is in miliseconds you will need to remove 3 zeros from the end
   - Change: `1088640000000`
   - To: `1088640000`
4. Paste your updated Unix epoch in dEth Tools to verify it is correct:

5. Go back to the [`targetDAO.tsx`](https://github.com/HausDAO/publichaus/blob/main/src/targetDAO.tsx#L31) file you are editing on GitHub.
6. Change:

```tsx
STAKE_NEXT_START: 1711976936; // last end 1704222000, //
```

to:

```tsx
STAKE_NEXT_START: 1088640000; // last end 1711976936, //
```

(notice you take the previous Epoch time and replace last end comment and paste the new time as `STAKE_NEXT_START`)

6. Click commit changes
7. Add Extended description: "Pause staking and update date for resuming"
8. Select "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request"
9. Name branch: `earth2travis-retro5` (your GitHub username dash current retro number)
