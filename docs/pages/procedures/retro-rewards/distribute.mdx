# Distribute Retro Rewards

After the Retro Rewards Signal Session ends it is time to calculate the results and distribute the rewards.

Each team that contributed will have an equal amount of their share distributed amongst team members. The execution of the contract below adds $HAUS to the treasury and distributes `nvPUB` to contributors from the Season providing increased stake in the PublicHaus DAO.

It is important that these funds are distributed prior to executing the TCR related the next season's objectives so voting weights reflect the rewards.

## Calculate Results

Open the [DAOhaus Retro Rewards 2024](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H3LddNt9qqzbfUJf2My6N79QCz440l653lFPcswULbA/edit?usp=sharing) Google Sheet. If you do not have access please request it from Ξ2T.

Duplicate the `Season #` and `Season # Splits` tabs and rename them according to the current season.

You will need to populate the data in the spreadsheet from the corresponding TCR. For Example, [Public HAUS Retro #5 Take 2](https://signal.daohaus.fun/#/0xa/0xf5d6b637a9185707f52d40d452956ca49018247a/tcr/0x204c5653279e502c507b6938d14f4e4878742c91)

1. Copy the name of **Projects** into Column A

2. For each project, copy the **Total Staked** number in white and paste it into the spreadsheet.
3. For each project, copy the **Quadratic Votes** number in red and paste it into the spreadsheet.
4. Calculate the totals for both **Total Staked** and **Quadratic Votes**

5. For the **Total nvPUB** paste the total from the DAO Tokens section of the [DAO Settings](https://admin.daohaus.club/#/molochv3/0xa/0xf5d6b637a9185707f52d40d452956ca49018247a/settings) page.
6. **Participation %** is calculated by dividing **Total Staked** by **Total nvPUB**.
7. **Distribution** is calculated by multiplying **Participation %** by 4000 (amount of $HAUS rewarded for the season).
8. Calculate **Quadratic %** by dividing each project's **Quadratic Votes** by the **Total Quadratic Votes** and multiplying by 100.

Make sure to use the $ signs in the denominator to lock that cell into the formula.

**For Example**: `=(C2/$C$7)*100`

9. Add the **Description** of each project from the Retro Rewards TCR.
10. Calculate **Total Rewards** for each project by multiplying the **Distribution** times the **Quadratic %** divided by 100.

Make sure to use the $ signs to lock that cell into the formuala.

**For Example**: `=($B$10*(D2/100))`

### Season Splits

Copy the **Projects** and **Total Rewards** into the Splits tab associated with the current season.

Make sure the formulas refer to tab you have been updating.

**For Example**: `=('Season 5'!$B$10*('Season 5'!D2/100))`

Verify the data is the same.

### Add Accounts

Next you need to add the wallet address of each project participant. These will be the addresses on Optimism that `nvPUB` rewards are sent to.

Below each project add a row for each project team member. Add their name and wallet address from the PublicHaus [Members](https://admin.daohaus.club/#/molochv3/0xa/0xf5d6b637a9185707f52d40d452956ca49018247a/members) page.

### Share Results

In the "Shipped in Season #" Discord thread associated with the season and on Twitter post messages similar to this:

> The results from Public HAUS Retro 5 Take 2 are in!
> https://signal.daohaus.fun/

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bk10e119C.png)

> There was a total of 200,907.94 nvPUB staked in this retro reward round for a participation rate of 30%

> There will be 1196.654681 `nvPUB` distributed between the following projects:

```md
| Projects         | Rewards     |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| Speedball        | 355.5938245 |
| YEET From Frames | 309.359768  |
| Cookie Jar       | 194.1301766 |
| NFT Raider       | 169.505995  |
| DIN              | 168.0649171 |
```

Use Chat GPT to create the Markdown tables from the Google Sheet.

### Gather Missing Accounts

For each project post the **Team** and **Address** Markdown table in the "Shipped in Season #" thread similar to the table below.

> Please reply to the messages below to confirm the wallet addresses of the project team members:

```md
| Name     | Address                                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Dekan    | 0xbaf6e57a3940898fd21076b139d4ab231dcbbc5f |
| Sam      | 0x83ab8e31df35aa3281d630529c6f4bf5ac7f7abf |
| Abhi     |                                            |
| Ξ2T      | 0xbc5b552641e5d203f0a6c230aa9dc14da7450053 |
| Santiago |                                            |
```

`@` mention to confirm the know addresses are correct and to get the wallet of those missing.

### Calculate Rewards

Fill out the **Rewards** column by dividing the **Total Rewards** for each project by the number of team members.

Make sure to use the $ signs to lock that cell into the formula.

**For Example**: `=$B$2/5`

### Add Rewards

Some team members will have contributed to multiple projects. Copy and paste the **Team Column** and ask Chat GPT to "Count how many instances of each name there are:"

That table can be copied and pasted into the bottom of the Splits tab.

For members who have contributed to multiple teams add additional rows under their name.

Fill out the **Project Name** for all contributors. Add their **Address** once and link to the **Rewards** for each project.

Make sure the total for this **Rewards** column matches the **Total Rewards** above.

For contributors on multiple projects create a formula to add their **Total** rewards.

**For Example**: `=sum(E23:E25)`

For contributors to one project just refer to the cell next to it.

Make sure the total for this **Total** column matches the **Rewards** column.

### Sum Rewards

Make a copy of the the rewards table you just filled out and paste it at the bottom of the sheet.

Remove the **Projects** and **Count** information. Remove any empty rows below a members name. Remove the **Rewards** heading and data.

In the **Totals** column link each cell to the total for that member from the **Totals** above. For members who only contributed to one project link that cell to the **Rewards** from above.

### Convert to WEI

Next the **Totals** need to be converted into WEI. dEth Tools [Eth Unit Conversion](https://tools.deth.net/eth-unit-conversion) is a good way to do this manually but the formula is: `=F46*1000000000000000000` (1 with 18 zeros)

### Create Arrays

The problem with using the formula is the commas have to be removed between the digits. You can do that with the Chat-GPT prompt below.

Copy and paste the **Address** data into Chat-GPT with the following prompt:

```bash
Create a JavaScript array with these addresses:

{addresses}

The array should only be the brackets. It does not need a name or equals sign. It is also not necessary to include the semicolon.
```

Paste the results into the spreadsheet under **`\_accounts (address[])`**

Copy and paste the **WEI** data into Chat-GPT with the following prompt:

```bash
Create a JavaScript array with these amounts:

{amounts}

The array should only be the brackets. It does not need a name or equals sign. Please remove the commas between the digits. It is also not necessary to include the semicolon.
```

Paste the results into the spreadsheet under **`_claims (uint256[])`**

### A Second Look

Now that the spreadsheet is complete please send it to another DAO member to verify it is correct. Ask them to review the data and approve it.

## Transaction

The `StakeClaimShaman` contract on Optimism is at the following address: `0x22F09C11De8f059840FD8F60b11b8d60DeA0E011`

Goto the [Contract](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x22F09C11De8f059840FD8F60b11b8d60DeA0E011) on Optimistic Etherscan.

Drop down `Token Holdings` and make sure there is enough $HAUS to cover the **Total Rewards**.

### Create Batch

Next we need to create the contract transaction from the Gnosis Safe App.

The transaction will have to be signed by the [Elected Reward Committee](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/trees/10/24?compact=true&hatId=24.2.3)

Goto the Elected Reward Committee [Gnosis Safe](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=oeth:0x02Cd00B0Aec913c30577e4FCE3179aEd91D6C315) on Optimism.
