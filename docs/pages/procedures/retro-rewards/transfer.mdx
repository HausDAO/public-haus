# Transfer Retro Rewards

Next we need to ensure there is adequate $HAUS for the retro rewards. Currently 4000 $HAUS (~3% of total uncirculating supply) is converted in order to distribute `nvPUB` to contributors for each season.

We need to transfer that $HAUS from the [Gnosis Safe](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=oeth:0x02cd00b0aec913c30577e4fce3179aed91d6c315) on Optimism into the [`StakeClaimShaman`](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x22F09C11De8f059840FD8F60b11b8d60DeA0E011#code) contract.

The [Elected Reward Committee](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/trees/10/24?compact=true&hatId=24.3.2) is managed under Roles with Hats Protocol:

## Check Balance

Check the $HAUS balance of the [`StakeClaimShaman'](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x22F09C11De8f059840FD8F60b11b8d60DeA0E011#code) contract on the Optimism block explorer by clicking the drop-down below the Token Holdings label.
