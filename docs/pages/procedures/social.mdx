# Track Social Media Engagement

At the moment the only social channels we engage in are on Twitter. We do not have a strategy other than letting the world know we are still alive.

## Roles

This role is managed by the [XComs](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/trees/10/24?compact=true&hatId=24.2.2) hat currently worn by `earth2travis.eth`

## Tools

We have a [DAOhaus Social Tracking](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JwCL7GugTYn0uMumQ49VD1Q5i8n1VGlbKpAqN_SXqZw/edit?gid=0#gid=0) Google sheet for tracking engagement and measuring our performance.

## Procedure

At the beginning of each month we need to update the spreadsheet with the data from the previous month.

1. Open the [DAOhaus Social Tracking](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JwCL7GugTYn0uMumQ49VD1Q5i8n1VGlbKpAqN_SXqZw/edit?gid=0#gid=0) Google sheet
2. Add a new heading for the previous month
3. Scroll down to the beginning of the previous month in the [DAOhaus profile](https://x.com/DAOhaus)
4. `command+click` each tweet to open it in a new tab
5. Add the Type, Tweet, URL, Comments, Retweets, Likes, Bookmarks, and Views
6. Repeat for each tweet that month
7. Count the total number of T, RT, QT and add that below the months heading
8. Add a formula to calculate the sum for each column
9. Paste the data for that month into and the calculation script below into Chat GPT to identify the best performing tweet for that month
10. Make the best performing tweet bold
11. Ask Chat GPT to convert the table to Markdown and show you the code
12. Paste the code into that month's GitHub issue related to Reporting Social Media Engagement under a Data heading ([Example](https://github.com/orgs/HausDAO/projects/28/views/2?pane=issue&itemId=71607772))
13. Add bullets for the total amount of Tweets, Retweets, and Quote tweets
14. Embed the best performing tweet
15. Share the data and best performing Tweet in the [`ðŸ’¥-news-flash`](https://discord.com/channels/709210493549674598/758440646553370635) channel on Discord
16. Create Issue for the next month
17. Add reminder to calender to track next month's social media engagement
18. Add `social` tag to GitHub issue
19. Close the GitHub issue
20. Create GitHub issue for payment

## Calculations

```python
# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Define a performance metric
df["Performance"] = df["Comments"] + df["Retweets"] + df["Likes"] + df["Bookmarks"] + df["Views"]

# Find the tweet with the highest performance
best_performance_tweet = df.loc[df["Performance"].idxmax()]

best_performance_tweet
```
