    A public house, commonly known as a pub, is an establishment licensed to
    sell alcoholic drinks for consumption on the premises. Pubs are a
    cornerstone of British culture and are also found in many other countries.
    They typically serve a variety of alcoholic beverages, including beer, wine,
    and spirits, and often provide a selection of non-alcoholic drinks as well.
